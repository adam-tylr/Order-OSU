# Order OSU
A mobile app for ordering food on campus at Ohio State University

Order OSU was avilible on the App Store during the Spring 2016 semester. 

This was my first experience developing on iOS. I got the idea after the university launched online ordering for pickup at two of its locations. (Online was previously avilible for pizza delivery). Using the apple developer pages and lots of google searches I was able to get the basic ordering funtionality working over a weekend then continuted polishing it over the next few weeks.
